Part I:
Implement a class Employee. An employee has a name (a string) and a salary (a double).

Provide a constructor with two arguments

public Employee(String employeeName, double currentSalary)
and methods

public String getName()
public double getSalary()
public void raiseSalary(double byPercent)
These methods return the name and salary, and raise the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain
percentage.

Sample usage:
Employee harry = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 50000);
harry.raiseSalary(10); // Harry gets a 10 percent raise
Supply an EmployeeTester class that tests all methods. Ensure that the salary is properly
formatted in dollars and cents using the NumberFormat class.



Part II:
Implement a class Product. A product has a name and a price, for example new
Product("Toaster", 29.95). Supply methods getName, getPrice, and reducePrice. Supply a
program ProductPrinter that makes two products, prints each name and price, reduces their prices
by $5.00, and then prints the prices again. Use the NumberFormat class to format the price into
dollars and cents.
