Part I:
Write a Java application that prompts the user for a measurement in meters and then converts it
to miles, feet, and inches. One meter is the equivalent of .000621371 miles. One meter is the
equivalent of 3.28084 feet. One meter is the equivalent of 39.3701 inches. Use the Scanner
class and the nextLine() method to collect the input from the user.


Part II:
Write a Java application that prompts the user for two times in military format (0900, 1730) and
prints the number of hours and minutes between the two times. Here is a sample run. User input
is underlined.
Please enter the first time: 0900
Please enter the second time: 1730
8 hours 30 minutes
Make sure your application can deal with the case where the first time is later than the second
time (ie the first time is 1730 and the second time is 0900). In this case, the time difference is 15
hours and 30 minutes.
