Part I:
A compass needle points a given number of degrees away from North, measured
clockwise. Write a Java application that reads the angle and prints out the nearest compass
direction, one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. In the case of of a tie, prefer the nearest principal
direction (N, S, E, or W).


Part II:
Write a Java application that reads in the name and salary of an employee. Here the
salary will dent an hourly wage, such as $9.25. Then ask how many hours the employee worked
in the past week. Be sure to accept fractional hours. Compute the pay. Any overtime work
(over 40 hours per week) is paid at 150% of the regular wage. Print a paycheck for the
employee. In the final solution be sure to include a Paycheck class.
