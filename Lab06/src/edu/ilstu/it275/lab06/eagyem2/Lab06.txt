Part I:
Write a Java application with loops that compute each of the following.
• The sum of all even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive)
• The sum of all squares between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
• All powers of 2 from 2 to the 0th power up to 2 to the 20th power
• The sum of all odd numbers between a and b (inclusive), where a and b are inputs.
• The sum of all odd digits of an input. (For example, if the input is 32677, the sum
would be 3 + 7 + 7 = 17).


Part II:
Write a Java application that reads in a line of input as a string and prints each of the
following.
• Only the upper case letters in the string
• Every second letter of the string
• The string, with all vowels (A, E, I, O, U) by an underscore
• The number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in the string
• The positions of all vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in the string
