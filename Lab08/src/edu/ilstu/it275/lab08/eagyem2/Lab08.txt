Part I:
Implement the Coin class described in Section 8.2 of your book. Modify the
CashRegister class so that coins can be added to the cash register, by supplying the method:
public void receivePayment(int coinCount, Coin coin)
The caller needs to invoke this method multiple times, once for each type of coin that is present
in the payment.


Part II:
Modify the giveChange method of the CashRegister class so that it returns the number of
coins of a particular type to return:
int giveChange(Coin coin)
The caller needs to invoke this method for each coin type, in decreasing value.
