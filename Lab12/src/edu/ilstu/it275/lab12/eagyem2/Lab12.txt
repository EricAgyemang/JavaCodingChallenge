Part I:
Write a Java application that reads text from a file and breaks it up into individual
words.

First, insert the words into a tree set. At the end of the input file, print all words,
followed by the size of the resulting set. This first part of the application
determines how many unique words a text file has.
Next, in addition to inserting the words into a tree set, insert each word int a map
whose keys are the word lengths and whose values are comma-separated stings of
words of the same length. At the end of the input file, print out all of the comma
separated strings, in increasing order by the length of their entries.
