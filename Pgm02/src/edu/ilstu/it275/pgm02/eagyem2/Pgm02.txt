Part I:
Provide a class for authoring a simple letter.
In the constructor, supply the names of the sender and the recipient:
public Letter(String from, String to)
Supply a method public void addLine(String line) to add a line of text to the body of the letter.
Supply a method public String getText() that returns the entire text of the letter.

The text has the form:
Dear recipient name:
blank line
first line of the body
second line of the body
. . .
last line of the body
blank line
Sincerely,
blank line
sender name
Also supply a class LetterPrinter that prints this letter.
Dear John:
I am sorry we must part.
I wish you all the best.
Sincerely,
Mary

Construct an object of the Letter class and call addLine twice. Hints: (1) Use the concat method
to form a longer string from two shorter strings. (2) The special string "\n" represents a new line.
For example, the statement body = body.concat("Sincerely,").concat("\n"); adds a line containing
the string "Sincerely," to the body.



Part II:
Implement a class Balloon. A balloon starts out with radius 0. Supply a method public void
inflate(double amount) that increases the radius by the given amount. Supply a method public
double getVolume() that returns the current volume of the balloon. Use Math.PI for the value of
Ï€. To compute the cube of a value r, just use r * r * r.

Write a class Battery that models a rechargeable battery. A battery has a constructor public
Battery(double capacity) where capacity is a value measured in milliampere hours. A typical AA
battery has a capacity of 2000 to 3000 mAh. The method public void drain(double amount)
drains the capacity of the battery by the given amount. The method public void charge() charges
the battery to its original capacity. The method public double getRemainingCapacity() gets the
remaining capacity of the battery.
