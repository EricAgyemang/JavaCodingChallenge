Part I:
Simulate a circuit for controlling a hallway light that has switches at both ends of the hallway.
Each switch can be up or down, and the light can be on or off. Toggling either swtich turns the
light on or off. Provide each of the following methods methods:
public int getFirstSwitchState() // 0 for down (off), 1 for up (on)
public int getSecondSwitchState() // 0 for down (off), 1 for up (on)
public int getLightState() // 0 for off, 1 for on
public void toggleFirstSwitch()
public void toggleSecondSwitch()
public int getSwitchState(int switch)
public void toggleSwitch(int switch)

Write a CircuitTester class that tests all switch combinations, printing out actual and expected
states for the switches and light.


Part II:
Write a class RaceWalker that models a race walker moving along a horizontal line. The race
walker moves either to the right or left. Initially, the race walker moves to the right, but it can
turn to change its direction. In each move, its position changes by one unit in the current
direction. Provide a constructor:
public RaceWalker(int initialPosition)
and methods:
public void turn()
public void move()
public int getPosition()
Sample usage:
RaceWalker rw = new RaceWalker(10)
rw.move(); // now is at position 11
rw.turn();
rw.move(); // now is at position 10

Your RaceWalkterTester should construct a race walker, make it move and turn a few times, and
print the actual and expected position.
