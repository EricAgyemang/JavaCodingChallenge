Part I:
Write a Java application that prompts the user for a year and prints the month and day of Easter
Sunday.

Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring. To compute the date, an
algorithm, invented by the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1800 can be used.

Let y be the year (such as 2001)
Divide y by 19 and call the reminder a. Ignore the quotient.
Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c
Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e
Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder
Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient
Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a reminder k
Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder
Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient
Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n. Ignore the remainder
Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder p. Ignore the quotient

Then Easter falls on day p of month n. For example, if y is 2001:
n = 4 and p = 15, so in 2001, Easter fell on April 15.



Part II:
Implement a Triangle class with the appropriate methods to support the supplied list of triangle
properties. Supply a program that prompts a user for the corner point coordinates. The corner
point coordinates are defined by the x- and y- coordinates of its three corner points. The Triangle
class needs to be able to compute the following properties of a given triangle.

This website has a good formula for finding the area: https://www.mathopenref.com/heronsformula.html

Note: The java Math functions work in angles based on radians, not degrees. To convert radians
to degrees use this formula: angle in degrees = angle in radians * (180 / 3.1415)
The lengths of all sides
The angles of all corners
The perimeter
The area
