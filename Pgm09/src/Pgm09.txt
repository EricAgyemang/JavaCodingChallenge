Part I:
Implement a class Clock whose getHours and getMinutes methods return the current time at ISU
(Use java.tim.Instant.now().toString() and extract the time from that string). Also provide a
getTime method that returns a string with hours and minutes by calling the getHours and
getMinutes methods. Also provide a subclass of Clock, AlarmClock that adds an additional
method setAlarm(hours, minutes) in order to set the time the alarm clock will ring. 

Within the AlarmClock, when getTime is called and the alarm time has been reached or exceeded, return the
time followed by the String “Alarm! Alarm!” and then clear the alarm.



Part II:
Implement a superclass Appointment and subclasses OneTime, Daily, and Monthly. An
appointment has a description (for example, “see doctor”) and a date (use the type
java.time.LocalDate). Write a method occursOn(int year, int month, int day) that checks whether
the appointment occurs on that date. For example, for a monthly appointment, you must check
whether the day of the month matches. The fill an array of Appointment objects with a mixture
of appointments. Have the user enter a date and print out all appointments that occur on that
date.

Next, give the user the option to add new appointments where they specify the type of the
appointment (one time, daily, monthly), the description, and the date.
