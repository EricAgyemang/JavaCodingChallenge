Part I:
Write a class PrimeSequence that implements the Sequence interface from Lab10 and produces a
sequence of prime numbers. Remember, a prime number is a whole number greater than 1,
whose only two whole number factors are 1 and itself. The Sieve of Erathosthenes can be used
to generate the list of prime numbers.



Part II:
Consider an interface
public interface NumberFormatter {
String format(int n);
}

Provide three classes that implement this interface. A DefaultFormatter formats an integer in the
usual way. A DecimalSeparatorFormatter formats an integer with decimal separators; for
example, one million as 1,000,000. An AccountingFormatter formats negative numbers with
parentheses; for example, -1 as (1). 

Also provide a test class to exercise each of the three specific
formatter classesâ€™s functionality.
