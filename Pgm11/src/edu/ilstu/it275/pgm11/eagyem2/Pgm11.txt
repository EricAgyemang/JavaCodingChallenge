Part I:
Using the following mechanism to read data from a URL connection, write a Java application
that reads all the data from a specific URL and writes it to a file. Prompt the user for the full

URL and the file name to write to.
String urlAddr = â€œhttp://hostmann.com/index.html";
URL pageLoc = new URL(urlAddr);
Scanner in = new Scanner(pageLoc.openStream());

After this sequence of statements, simply read the contents of the web page with the Scanner in
the usual way. The URL constructor and the openStream method can throw an IOException so
ensure you are dealing with that possibility appropriately.


Part II:
Write a Java application that checks the spelling of all words in a file. It should read each work
of a file and check whether it is contained within a word list. A word list is available in the
words.txt file associated with this assignment The application should print out all words that it
cannot find in the word list.
