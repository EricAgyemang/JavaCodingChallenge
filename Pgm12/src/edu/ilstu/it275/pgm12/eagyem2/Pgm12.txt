Part I:
Write a Java application that reads text from a file and breaks it up into individual
words. For each work extracted, add it to a map whose key is the phone keypad
spelling of the word and whose value is the set of words with the same code. For
example, 27336 is mapped to the set “Andes”, “coder”, “codes”. 

After reading the text
file and populating the map, prompt the user for numbers and then print out all of the words in
the dictionary that can be spelled with that number.


Part II:
Write a program that checks whether a sequence of HTML tags is properly nested. For each
opening tag, such as <p>, there must be a closing tag </p>. A tag such as <p> may have other
tags inside, for example
<p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <a> </a> </p>

The inner tags must be closed before the outer ones. Your program should process a file
containing the tags. 

For simplicity, assume that the tags are separated by spaces, and that there is
no text inside the tags.
